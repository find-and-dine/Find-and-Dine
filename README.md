# Find and Dine

This is a mockup of a "Image Gallery and Mosaic" component for a restaurant reviews app.
I built this application to advance my skills in CSS. I was challenged to build the entire Photo Gallery and a modal that displayed a carousel. This project was challenging because I did not use any packages or extra libraries to create my component.
Please navigate to the "working" branch for most up-to-date code.
Built with HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, and Docker.
